The dataset consists of 1126 images with 1126 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*polyp*).

Images in the Fine Grained Polyp dataset have . All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (788 images), *test* (225 images), and *val* (113 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 cls: ***ad*** (760 images), ***hp*** (190 images), and ***ass*** (176 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***histologia*** tag.
