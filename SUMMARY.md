**Swin-Expand: Fine-Grained Polyp Segmentation and Classification** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 1126 images with 1126 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*polyp*).

Images in the Fine Grained Polyp dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (788 images), *test* (225 images), and *val* (113 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***histologia*** and ***cls*** tag. The dataset was released in 2023 by the ES joint research group.
